# Operational Performance Dashboard – Power BI

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis and dashboard development using Power BI. 
The objective was to transform raw operational data into meaningful KPIs and interactive visualizations 
to support monitoring, trend analysis, and decision-making.

## Project Overview
Operational teams often handle large volumes of activity across regions and departments. 
This dashboard provides a consolidated view of key performance metrics such as volume, 
processing time, error rates, and delays.

## Data Preparation
- Imported CSV data into Power BI
- Used Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
- Handled delimiter parsing, header promotion, and data type validation
- Ensured clean, analysis-ready data before modeling

## Key Metrics (DAX)
- Total Volume
- Average Processing Time
- Total Errors
- Delay Rate

## Dashboard Features
- KPI cards for high-level performance monitoring
- Regional comparison of operational volume
- Processing time trend analysis
- Department-level drill-down table
- Interactive slicers for region and department filtering

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query
- DAX

## Outcome
This project showcases the ability to independently analyze data, create KPIs, 
build interactive dashboards, and clearly communicate insights.
The analytical approach is domain-agnostic and applicable to engineering or operational datasets.
